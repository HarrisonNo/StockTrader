StockTrader
=============

Usage: "python3 bob_the_builder.py all|build_all|debug_build_debug"

This program is intended as a logical abstraction layer between a stock broker REST api
and some generalized user stock trading commmands. With the intent being that various stock
broker REST apis can be swapped out with minimal logical oversight required.

This is very much a V1.0. Further progress can theoretically be made in both the advanced unit tests
and in the ratcheting zone between the logical layer and the REST layer. More likely however this should
be rewritten and cleaned up as this rough draft presents several unnecessary problems. Rewritting in Rust
would be quite beneficial due to the dedicated unit test infrastructure present alongside the infinitely more
robust macro system.

TODO: Rewrite this entire project in either C++ or Rust.
